In 2015, in collaboration with some [very talented colleagues](http://smphr.ca/team/), I founded Semaphore Campaigns, a cooperative that brings together professionals from several domains: political organizing, web development, graphic design, and communications.

We work with clients that share our progressive values. Effective organizing empowers communities, builds bridges, communicates messages, and–above all–fosters meaningful, lasting relationships. We are here to give you the tools to do it. Our motivation is the success of our client organizations and their campaigns.

I developed our bespoke website using WordPress, Bootstrap, and jQuery. It was rolled out in under two weeks, including team feedback. Nicolas Romer developed the logo and Lisa Hoffman perfected much of the copy. We worked as a team to establish a coherent brand guide.
