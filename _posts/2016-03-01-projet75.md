Projet 75, and the Sommet des Femmes, aimed to underscore the 75th anniversary of women's right to vote in the province and mobilize to address the glaring representation gap in public office.

I developed and maintained the website with a bespoke theme and configured CiviCRM integration. The website served as an mass email, event registration, and donation platform.

I worked alongside [Marie-Jules Morris Bourgouin](https://twitter.com/Mjaymb) to publish and produce content.
