At [CleverToday](http://CleverToday.com) I had the opportunity to work on several exciting projects.

These varied in scope from working with the whole team to develop a flexible platform for the [various](https://www.clevertoday.com/portfolio/arthaus-condos/)  [properties](https://www.clevertoday.com/fr/realisations/condos-beaumont/)  of a large local developer to making the existing website for the University of Montreal's cancer research  [institute](https://www.clevertoday.com/portfolio/iric/) mobile friendly. We worked extensively with Docker and Jenkins to ensure continual development for all projects. Most projects were developed on Wordpress, but I was frequently tasked with projects on different platforms, ranging from creating an Ionic app to developing a demo e-commerce platform on Microsoft Episerver.
