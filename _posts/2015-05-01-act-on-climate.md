Worked alongside Nicolas Romer and Lisa Hoffman to produce this WordPress, responsive website to promote participation in one of Canada's largest ever marches for climate justice. I was specifically responsible for the day-of front-page, including bespoke Twitter and Facebook integration and a live blog.
