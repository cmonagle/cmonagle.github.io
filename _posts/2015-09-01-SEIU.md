SEIU healthcare is over 70 years old, and represents 55,000 workers in Ontario and British Columbia. They have taken the Ontario government to court successfully several times, winning major victories for service workers.

Their current site was targeted to their already-unionized members. They wanted a new page to inform and engage potential organizing leads. People coming to the site were likely tired and frustrated, so their questions needed to be answered quickly. The users would also primarily have english as a second language, so engaging and easy-to-understand visuals were critical.

We worked closely with SEIU’s communications strategist to create a fun, interactive, and engaging website to get users involved in the union. An instant chat application was developed which connected with organizer’s phones to ensure instant feedback for the user’s questions. A distinct graphic treatment was created to separate it from the main site, while keeping with the fundament of the brand.

Organizing leads now have a portal through which to get their questions answered quickly and easily, and learn about the advantages of unionization. The process for learning about and becoming unionized is more fluid and accessible.
