I've had the privilege of working with [Campaign Gears](http://campaigngears.ca) on several projects. Campaign Gears is a web agency based in Toronto, Ontario that provides non-profits and associations with the tools they need to launch successful campaigns.

I helped complete the redesign of their recently launched website, including several interactive components in NationBuilder. I also worked to develop the front and back end of an innovative contact your legislator tool. The front end was a modular widget using vanilla Javascript with a well organized MVC structure. It was designed to work with both the tool I developed and an existing PHP backend. I developed the RESTful API backend using Django in Python and used a geocoding API with the Represent API to lookup elected officials. I was responsible for deployment and maintenance.
